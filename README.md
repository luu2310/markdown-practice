2. **Prepare fillings**:
   - Slice shrimp or pork.
   - Wash lettuce and herbs.
   - Cut cucumber and carrot into sticks.
3. **Roll the spring rolls**:
   - Dip rice paper in warm water for 2–3 seconds.
   - Place lettuce, noodles, vegetables, and meat on the lower part.
   - Fold sides and roll tightly from bottom to top.

- *Tip:* Do **not** soak rice paper too long.
- *Tip:* Cover finished rolls with a **damp cloth** so they don’t dry.

Use the simple rule `dip_fast_roll_tight` to remember how to work with rice paper.
